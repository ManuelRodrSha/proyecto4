         "Monthai Mahataweit the a young man of 18 years old is handsome and amazing in every way whether it’s education or his family’s name. He is also the only son of a wealthy official Jao Khun Mahat and Khun Ying (Lady) Tap Tim. He is the lover of Viyada Hiranwat a pretty young lady who is approved by Khun Ying Tap Tim because she is equal in rank and status she also wants to them to get engaged before Monthai goes to school overseas.  One day the little girl Bpee climbs the fence while Viyda was imploring and whiny with Monthai; causing Bpee to no longer hold in her laugh; embarrassed Viyada starts to beat and hit Bpee but Monthai helps her and asks her until he finds out that she lives with her grandmother “Yai Tiam” at the broken down hut; and that she climbed the gate because she wanted to pick the “Asoke” (Indian Flowering Plant) for food. Monthai out of pity gives her a small amount of money. Even though it was small to Bpee it was alot of money this had made a mark in her heart and placed Monthai as her benevolent person.  Jao Khun Mahat is a playboy type that has many wives and in those include nuan Nou Cha’s mother. Nou Cha is Monthai’s half brother and someone that Monthai is very close to and loves dearly. Tap Tip is afraid that Monthai is going to be like his father so she harrassed Lukkana an innocent young girl and the mother of the female kitchen maid. She does so because she is afraid that Lukkana will seduce Monthai causing Lukkana to get slapped and beat around often. With no choice Khun Jian which is Tap Tim’s best friend and head housekeeper warns Monthai to stay away and leave Lukkana alone for awhile  but Monthai doesn’t believe her because he thinks of Lukkana only as a little sister.  One day Wet Viyada’s father accidentally hits Yai Tiam causing her death. Before her death She had asked Weit to take care of Bpee. Viyda and her mother uses and abuses Bpee as she is a servant .. the only person in the house who cares about Bpee was Wiparwarn Viyada’s little sister. Viyada starts using Bpee as a messenger between her and monthai .. giving Bpee a chance to get to know how sweet and gentle Monthai is causing her to worship him even more. He buys an evening dress for her to join the party sending him off to school. Viyda is very angry and behind Monthai she secretly pinches Bpee out of jealousy and tells her to go home. Bpee goes and cry in a bushes and accidentally falls asleep.Monthai comes by and sees her and carries her home. While going home he accidentally bumps into Lukkana causing her to screeam. Jian and Tap tim comes and see them and thinks that have hid to flirt around. She beats Lukkana and then goes and slap her mother too. Monthai tries to stop his mother but it doesn’t work. Monthai promises to help prove Lukkana’s innocence in the morning  but before the morning Monthai and his mother has to see a gory image Lukkana had hanged herself to death. The relationship between mother and son falls apart once Monthai announces that he will never come home to let his mother see again.  On his departure date Bpee follows to send Monthai off and giving him a handkerchief with his name sewn into it Monthai then picks up an asoke flower that had fallen into the ground and gives it to her and tells her that no matter how far he goes he will always give her support.  After that Bpee has to move with Viyada’s family to Chiang Mai 10 years later Viyada is a different person who see’s many different man at the same time. The latest guy that Viyada had set sights on is Por Liang Pong In a rich and very attractive man the owner of a lumber company at the same time that Monthai is still writing love letters to Viyada always without knowing that the entire time it is actually Bpee that he is writing to him.. Bpee is close to Pong in and knows from him that the reason why he still carries himself single is because he has a harsh past with Maen Ward Bpees english language teacher from middle school.  After Monthai goes to continue school his father dies and his mother falls ill because her heart is still mourning. She is sick with a heart disease and also psychologically. Wipahwarn suggests Bpee goes and take care of her in place of Viyada who doesn’t want to go. Once Bpee arives she sees Tap Tim going into a shock seizure so she gives Tap Tim her finger to bite. Jian comes and see and realizes that its Bpee that was sent and not Viyada after mending Bpee’s wounds she takes her up to give respect and greet Tap Tim. Tap Tim doesn’t remember Bpee and calls her Viyada so Jian tells Bpee to pretend to be Viyada for awhile. Guer who is Monthais friend and Tap Tim’s doctor comes and is shocked because Tap Tim has improved alot since Bpee came.. he also starts to mistake Bpee for Viyada Monthai’s lover.  On the day that Monthai returns home Guer is the one that picks him up and drop him off. Monthai then asks about his mother condition. Guer tells him that his mother has gotten better because Viyada has been taking close care of her causing her to get better. Monthai quickly goes back to Mahataweit but is upset to find that it’s Bpee and that she had lied and pretended to be Viyada. Tap Tim is very angry that Monthai is back and also tries to get them to marry .. Monthai seeing that Pbee didn’t stop her. He assumes that she is trying to find the chance to marry him. Bpee is very upset so she responds that she already has a lover.  Monthai pretends to have love scenes towards Bpee by hugging and kissing her even in front of his mother and khun Jian to where Khun Jian has had to openly warn him. But Khun Ying Tap Tim likes it and backs them up to get closer. She even suggests Monthai to take Bpee out. While out they both bump into Maenward and Set Tee a young bankers son who followed Maen ward since Australia. Bpee asks Monthai to take her and send a telegram so she can call Pong In and tell him about Maen Ward. Monthai mistakes that she is calling her lover so he sarcastically sends one also.  Viyda goes to a party hosted by Pong In and sees that Sood Samoun a nurse has already been scoring points with Pong In. So she decides to seduce Pong In. Pong In denies her and then she cuts their relationship off and drinks in anger. That same night Keitchai who had been following her in hopes of getting with her thought that once he has slept with her then he will go and ask for her hand in marriage but she disses him and disrespect him saying he has no proper family name.  Viyada gets Monthai telegraph and goes down to mahataweit to see him and Monthai is afraid that she won’t be able to face his mother so Bpee goes and confesses the truth to Tap Tim instead of getting angry she is still attached to Bpee because of her kindness. Once Viayda gets there she is jealous of Bpee … On Pong In side gets Bpee telegram and quickly comes down to bangkok in hopes of getting back together with Maen ward but no matter what it doesn’t seem to work so he goes and ask Bpee for help. Monthai sees and mistakes him for her lover.  Nou Cha gets back from America after getting his master in interior design. Wiparwarn comes down to bangkok and tells him of what is going on between Monthai and Bpee and the two plan to get them to understand each other Viyada finds out and tries to tear Bpee’s face and embarrass her in front of everyone but it doesn’t work out she gets angry that the two had planned to help Bpee and Monthai so she goes and take revenge by going to see Nang Noun Nou Cha’s mother and convincing her that Nou Chai and Wi Par Warn doesn’t belong together because they are unequal in status. His mother then asks him to break it off with Wiparwarn … Nou Cha loves his mother alot so he sets Wiparwarn up to misunderstand by putting Bpee’s earing in his car for her to misunderstand. Bpee then finds a way for the two to work things out.  After a tireless attempt in order to get back with Maen Ward Pong in gives up and decides to go home so he goes and says goodbye to Bpee at Mahatweit .. Viyada sees and then calls Monthai causing both sides to argue and Khun Jian comes and stop them and takes them to see Khun Ying tap Tim. Tap Tim tells Pong in that if he wants to date Bpeeyachat he should do it correctly and come through the doors properly.

The series dealt with the adventures of two anthropomorphized tugboat fleets  the Star Fleet and the Z-Stacks  who compete against each other in the fictional Bigg City Port. The series was set in the Roaring Twenties  and was produced by Tugs Ltd.  for TVS and Clearwater Features Ltd. Music was composed by Junior Campbell and Mike O'Donnell  who also wrote the music for Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.  Due to the bankruptcy of production company TVS  the series did not continue production past 13 episodes. Following the initial airing of the series throughout 1988  television rights were sold to an unknown party  while all models and sets from the series sold to Britt Allcroft. Modified set props and tugboat models were used in Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends from 1991 onwards  with footage from the original program being heavily dubbed and edited for use in American children's series Salty's Lighthouse. Mitton returned to working with Thomas & Friends in 1991  while Cardona would go on to direct Theodore Tugboat  a similarly natured animated series set in Canada. All thirteen episodes of the show were released on VHS between 1988 and 1993.",

The core of the show was the partnership between two very different cops from two different cultures. Chicago cop Joey LaFiamma  played by Michael Paré  is transferred to Houston after he kills a mobster from a powerful Mafia family and a contract is put out on him. Once there  he is partnered with Levon Lundy  played by Michael Beck  the grandson of a Texas Ranger.  Although as different as night and day  and after a rocky beginning they form a successful partnership and become friends. This is aided to a certain extent by an event where a hitman from Chicago who holds the contract to shoot La Fiamma arrives in Houston and is ultimately killed by Lundy.  During the series  it is revealed that both La Fiamma and Lundy have their own personal demons; La Fiamma's Chicago police partner had been killed when he went ahead while La Fiamma had waited for backup to arrive. Lundy's wife had been killed by an explosion that was intended to kill him.",

Some non-native characters had important roles: the restaurant/motel owner  the band manager  the nurse and the town's main RCMP officer. The show explored themes of Native poverty  alcoholism  cultural preservation and conflict over land settlements and natural resource exploitation. Originally somewhat light-hearted  it quickly became a more dramatic and ponderous series.",
